# Simple MIPS web compiler

Mips compiler developed for Computer Organization class at UERGS (Rio Grande do Sul State University). It returns a memory code to cut and paste on the VHDL memory file. Simply and easy. Built using html and javascript.

It works for a MIPS 32bits. It compiles for a Mips memory with cells size 8 bits. This memory cell size can be edited in the code as you want for your project.

It is a continuous project. I will try to update it as I can.

# Exemple code
The files named codigos-exemplos-compilador-mips2.txt and codigo-divisao-float.txt has examples of assembly code and how your code should be on this simple compiler.
