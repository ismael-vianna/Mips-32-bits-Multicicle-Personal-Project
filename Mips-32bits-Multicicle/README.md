It is a Mips 32 bits Multicicle project. It was developed for Computer Organization class at UERGS (Rio Grande do Sul State University). It has a memory with 512 cells of 8 bits each one. This project was written in VHDL on Vivado 2020.3. Use the Simple Compiler for it to create assembly codes. Copy and paste your compiled code on its memory. I'm take it as a project continuous. I will try to develop an ALU to work with float numbers.
